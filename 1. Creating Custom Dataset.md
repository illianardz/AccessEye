# 1. Creating Custom Dataset

## Gathering and Preparing Data
We retrieved datasets from Universe Roboflow with images containing vehicles, license plates, and the International Symbol of Access. We then annotated images with the following classes:
- vehicle
- license_plate
- symbol of access

## Choosing a Model Architecture
For our model selection, we chose the following in Roboflow:
- Model Type: Roboflow 3.0 Object Detection (Fast)
- Checkpoint: COCOn

## Generating our Dataset
We continued using Roboflow to generate our custom dataset with the following conditions:
- Pre-Process:
  - Auto-Orient: Applied
  - Resize: Stretch to 640x640
- Data Augmentation:
  - Crop: 0% Minimum Zoom, 20% Maximum Zoom
  - Rotation: Between -15° and +15°
  - Shear: ±10° Horizontal, ±10° Vertical
  - Noise: Up to 0.1% of pixels
- Split Data: 87% training, 8% validation, 4% testing
