# 1. Creating Custom Dataset

## Gathering and Preparing Data
To build a dataset, we retrieved exisiting datasets from Universe Roboflow that included images with vehicles, license plates, and the International Symbol of Access. We then annotated the images to identify the following three classes:
- **vehicle**
- **license_plate**
- **symbol of access**

## Choosing a Model Architecture
For our project, we selected the **Roboflow 3.0 Object Detection (Fast)** model due to its efficiency in processing and handling real-time data streams. We paired this with the **COCOn checkpoint** to enhance its overall accuracy and performance.

## Generating our Dataset
To maximize our model, we applied the following preprocessing and augmentation techniques using Roboflow:
- **Pre-Process:**
  - Auto-Orient: Adjusts image orientation automatically
  - Resize: Standardizes images to 640x640 pixels
- **Data Augmentation:**
  - Crop: Applies random cropping to images, ranging from 0% to 20% zoom
  - Rotation: Randomly rotates images between -15° and +15° to simulate different angles
  - Shear: ±10° horizontally and vertically
  - Noise: Adds noise to up to 0.1% of the pixels
- **Split Data:**
  - 87% training, 8% validation, 4% testing
